### npm-run

This is a cross platform tool to quickly pick a script from a `package.json` located at your current directory.

Install globally and then run it from anywhere with either `npmrun` or `npr`.
You will be presented with an alphabetically sorted list of the scripts in the `package.json` file.
You can select a script using the arrow keys up and down and then press enter and the tool with place into your clipboard `npm run {SCRIPT YOU PICKED}`

I used node-copy-paste as it claims to support the copying out to your clipboard across windows and unix systems.
